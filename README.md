# README
For New Teams. Here are some things that helped us. From codes to files.

## SETTING UP PAGES WEBSITE
In the directory, go to settings and find pages in the sidebar. 
From there, under Build and Deployment, there will be a section for Branch.
Change the Branch from None to Main and click save.

Give it a few minutes and then go to `https://nmca-gsc.github.io/GSC-{YEAR}/?src=https://github.com/NMCA-GSC/GSC-{YEAR}/blob/main/README.md`

Change {YEAR} to the current year to match the directory name.

Example of a running one: [README WEBSITE][1]
